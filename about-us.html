                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>In 1904 chemical engineers Emory Smith and Arthur Emery began their business with a
                    simple goal of providing compliant high-quality data and establishing long-term partnerships with
                    their
                    clients through strong service and customer satisfaction. The company’s mission emerged from their
                    curiosity and intellectual rigor to strive to develop and use their knowledge and expertise to
                    produce
                    uncompromised data and provide their customers with timely and accurate testing, helping to create
                    safer
                    working and living environments with their resulting data. Our earliest customers were the City and
                    County of San Francisco, who counted on our laboratory for accurate test results in feed provided to
                    the
                    horses that pulled the city / county fire - police equipment.</p>
                <p>Today, Positive Lab Service &#40;PLS&#41; has emerged from its original 5 person
                    staff
                    to a team of professionals with an average tenure of 19 years, honing the skills necessary to find
                    the
                    best ways to develop and test and provide our clients with unmatched industry knowledge.</p>
