            <h2>History</h2>
            <p class="blue-text">In 1904 chemical engineers Emory Smith and Arthur Emery began their business with a
                simple goal of providing compliant high-quality data and establishing long-term partnerships with their
                clients through strong service and customer satisfaction. The company’s mission emerged from their
                curiosity and intellectual rigor to strive to develop and use their knowledge and expertise to produce
                uncompromised data and provide their customers with timely and accurate testing, helping to create safer
                working and living environments with their resulting data. Our earliest customers were the City and
                County of San Francisco, who counted on our laboratory for accurate test results in feed provided to the
                horses that pulled the city / county fire - police equipment.</p>
            <p class="blue-text">Today, Positive Lab Service &#40;PLS&#41; has emerged from its original 5 person staff
                to a team of professionals with an average tenure of 19 years, honing the skills necessary to find the
                best ways to develop and test and provide our clients with unmatched industry knowledge.</p>
